The National Science Foundation has awarded a $1.6 million BIGDATA grant to Drexel University, in collaboration with the University of Washington, University of Michigan and University of Massachusetts Amherst to research and develop responsible data science methods targeting the early stages of the data life cycle.

Julia Stoyanovich, Computer Science faculty at New York University, is the Principal Investigator (PI) for the grant, which provides funding from September 2017 through August 2021. Stoyanovich will work with Co-PIs Bill Howe, Director of Urbanalytics and Associate Professor in the Information School at UW, H. V. Jagadish, the Bernard A. Galler Collegiate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UM, and Gerome Miklau, Professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMA.

The project, Foundations of Responsible Data Management, develops techniques and practices to reduce the introduction of algorithmic bias and privacy leaks, while supporting transparency, in the pre-processing of big data. In contrast to existing work on these topics, which has focused on data mining, modeling, analysis and machine learning, this project addresses upstream processes that generate input data for analysis, from discovery and acquisition to querying, ranking and the generation of synthetic data. This work is part of Data, Responsibly, based at Drexel University, which builds tools to embed legal and ethical norms into data sharing, collection and analysis.
