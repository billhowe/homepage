As research becomes increasingly data-intensive, scientists are relying on visualization very early in the
data analysis cycle. We find that existing tools assume a "one-at-a-time" workflow for creating
visualizations and impose a steep learning curve that makes it difficult to rapidly create and review
visualizations. At the same time, scientists are becoming more cognitively overloaded, spending an
increasing proportion of time on data “handling” tasks rather than scientific analysis. In response, we
developed VizDeck, a web-based visual analytics tool for relational data that automatically recommends a
set of appropriate visualizations based on the statistical properties of the data and adopts a card game
metaphor to present the results to the user. 

Our recent work has been through a collaboration with Jeff Heer's group to develop Voyager and Voyager2, systems integrating visualization recommendation and conventional visualization specification. We've found that a hybrid interface delivers benefits beyond what either approach can do alone, allowing users to both explore the data broadly through recommendation and design specific visualizations to explore particular aspects of the data.  The key architectural insight was to model the recommendation constraints as a query over a virtual space of possible visualizations.
