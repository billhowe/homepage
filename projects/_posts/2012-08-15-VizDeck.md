title: "VizDeck: Visualization Recommendation"

excerpt: "VizDeck recommends visualizations based on the statistical properties of the data tempered by perception heuristics.  Dashboards are assembled through a card-game UI."

As research becomes increasingly data-intensive, scientists are relying on visualization very early in the
data analysis cycle. We find that existing tools assume a "one-at-a-time" workflow for creating
visualizations and impose a steep learning curve that makes it difficult to rapidly create and review
visualizations. At the same time, scientists are becoming more cognitively overloaded, spending an
increasing proportion of time on data “handling” tasks rather than scientific analysis. In response, we
present VizDeck, a web-based visual analytics tool for relational data that automatically recommends a
set of appropriate visualizations based on the statistical properties of the data and adopts a card game
metaphor to present the results to the user. We describe the design of VizDeck and discuss the results of
a usability evaluation comparing VizDeck with three other popular visualization tools. We then discuss
design considerations for visualization tools focused on rapid analysis based on observed sensemaking
processes.
