title: Clustering Billion-Edge Graphs
excerpt: "Working at the intersection of network science, databases, and high-performance computing, we developed a series of novel parallel algorithms based on Infomap serial graph clustering algorithm.  Infomap has been shown to produce higher quality clusters in multiple third-party benchmarks; our parallel methods achieve comparable quality at massive scale through novel approximations."
