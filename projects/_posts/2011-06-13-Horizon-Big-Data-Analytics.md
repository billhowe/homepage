title: "Horizon: Big Data Analytics for Science"
excerpt: "The Horizon project was one of the early efforts to study the limits of Hadoop for complex analytics. We developed Hadoop algorithms for visualization, machine learning, and scientific data management, and extended the computation model to include iteration."

I am the lead PI on two NSF grants exploring the question of how cloud computing can support interactive, visual, exploratory science. Through an NSF Cluster Exploratory grant, and in partnership with visualization experts at the University of Utah, we are exploring the use of MapReduce as a common framework for both scalable data processing and scalable visualization. Through an NSF EAGER grant, I am developing a new visualization algebra for use with the Microsoft Azure platform. The core goal of both projects is to allow scientists to analyze terabytes of data in the cloud as efficiently, conveniently, and as deeply as they can analyze megabytes of data on their laptops.
