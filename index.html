<p>
I am an Associate Professor in the Information School, Adjunct Associate Professor in Computer Science &amp; Engineering.  I lead an interdisciplinary group in <a href="https://urbanalytics.uw.edu/">Responsible Data Science</a> with emphasis on urban applications. I was the Founding Associate Director in the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu">UW eScience Institute</a>; I continue to serve on the steering committee as a Senior Data Science Fellow.  I am a co-founder of <a href="http://urban.uw.edu/">Urban@UW</a>, and I lead UW's participation in the <a href="http://metrolab.uw.edu">MetroLab Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.cascadiadata.org/">Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative</a>. I created a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">first MOOC on Data Science</a> through Coursera, and I led the creation of the <a href="http://datasciencemasters.uw.edu/">UW Data Science Masters Degree</a>, serving as its inaugural Program Director and Faculty Chair.  I serve on the Steering Committee of the <a href="https://www.csss.washington.edu/">Center for Statistics in the Social Sciences</a>.
</p>
<p>
My group's research aims to make the techniques and technologies of data science dramatically more accessible and reliable, particularly at scale.  Our methods are rooted in database models and languages, though we sometimes work in machine learning, visualization, HCI, and high-performance computing.  We are an applied, systems-oriented group, frequently sourcing projects through collaborations in the physical, life, and social sciences.

<ul>
<li>February 2019: Our demo paper on GraviTIE, a visualization tool for unsupervised learning over heterogeneous multi-modal datasets (art, scientific figures, twitter misinformation, and more) was accepted to the The Web Conference 2019.  Congratulations to Sean Yang and Luke Rodriguez.</li>
<li>February 2019: I gave the SAGE Weston Roundtable Lecture at the University of Wisconsin Madison on public private partnerships and data sharing.  Thanks to the UniverCity Alliance for hosting a fantastic visit (despite the wintry weather!)</li>
<li>January 2019: Headed to a SciFoo event in a couple of weeks around social computing.</li> 
<li>January 2019: For <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/billhoweuw/database-agnostic-workload-management-cidr-2019">our talk at CIDR</a>, we emphasized that feature engineering for query workloads is pretty much obsolete --- simple token prediction models (e.g., word2vec) work well for pretty much everything.</li>
<li>November 2019: My student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/an-yan-9565b640">Annie Yan accepted an internship at Facebook in the ML group next summer.</a>
<li>October 2018: Our paper led by Shrainik Jain on <a href="publications/pdfs/jain_cidr_2019.pdf ">Database-Agnostic Workload Management</a> was accepted to <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2019/cfp.html">CIDR 2019</a>!  The proposed system uses NLP on the queries themselves to help predict errors, security violations, and approximate performance.</li>
<li>October 2018: I'm giving an invited talk at the <a href="https://tripods.soe.ucsc.edu/tripods-pi-workshop">TRIPODS PI meeting</a> with Lise Getoor on Responsible Data Science</li>
<li>September 2018: Our paper on <a href="publications/pdfs/young_open_v_closed_semi_synthetic_data.pdf">sharing semi-synthetic data and data governance</a> was accepted to <a href="https://fatconference.org/">FAT*</a>.  The paper was led by iSchool students Meg Young and Luke Rodriguez.</li>
<li>August 2018: Our <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2165-stoyanovich.pdf">panel at VLDB 2018</a> with Julia Stoyanovich, Jagadish, and Gerome Miklau attracted a full room!</li>
<li>July 26, 2018: I'm giving an invited talk at NSF on our work on algorithmic curation of science data repositories.

<li>July 18, 2018: I presented our paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08600.pdf">EZLearn</a> at IJCAI 2018 in Stockholm. EZLearn combines distant supervision and co-learning to avoid the need for training data in applications that have access to noisy free-text descriptions of data, especially in science.</li>
<li>July 10, 2018: Congratulation to Kanit (Ham) Wongsuphasawat for defending his thesis on visualization recommendation systems! Ham is joining Apple as a Research Scientist.</li>
